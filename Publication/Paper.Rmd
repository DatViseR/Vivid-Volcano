# Summary

Vivid Volcano is an R Shiny web application – an intuitive tool that
helps experimental scientists with no bioinformatics background explore
and analyze pre-processed omics data. It enables users to perform
crucial bioinformatic analyses without the help of specialists. With
Vivid Volcano, one can create highly customizable, publication-ready
volcano plots and perform comprehensive data exploration, and gene
ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Users can download variously
formatted publication-ready plots and neatly formatted tables that
adhere to scientific standards. Vivid Volcano empowers both exploratory
and explanatory data analysis.

# Statement of need

Modern biological research relies heavily on omics technologies
(genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, etc. ) that generate large,
complex datasets requiring specialized analysis and processing by
bioinformaticians – experts with a unique combination of programming,
statistics, and data science skills blended with biology domain
knowledge[@manzoni2018]. These experts build analysis pipelines which
produce pre-processed data conveying metadata on experiments and
statistical results for the changes in expression of thousands of
proteins, genes, etc. However, to draw valid biological conclusions,
this pre-processed data must be explored and explained by subdomain
experts who are usually experimentalists who designed the experiments.
Those often do not have strong computational skills to effectively
explore data and visualize crucial conclusions. Despite the widespread
adoption of omics technologies in biological research, many experimental
scientists struggle with data analysis due to technical barriers and
communication challenges between computational and experimental
disciplines, even with bioinformatician support.

Vivid Volcano was designed with two basic aims: 1. Empowering
experimental biologists with a tool that can help them explore and
analyze pre-processed omics data on their own 2. Lowering the workload
for bioinformaticians who can focus on more statistically and
computationally challenging tasks such as integration of complex
multiomics data

Vivid Volcano addresses a critical need in the biological research
community by empowering wet-lab scientists to independently analyze and
interpret preprocessed omics data without requiring programming
expertise or extensive bioinformatics support. The application provides
an accessible interface for uploading and diagnosing preprocessed omics
data, performing customized statistical analyses including gene set
enrichment analysis across more than 8,000 GO categories, and generating
publication-ready visualizations. Unlike many existing tools, Vivid
Volcano maintains a simple and efficient design that does not rely on
Bioconductor libraries, making it more accessible and easier to
maintain. Vivid Volcano was designed to provide a smooth and intuitive
user experience. For more advanced users who would like to validate the
under-the-hood processes, the application also implements a process log
system that tracks data processing outcomes, facilitating debugging and
enabling analysis of app functionality. These features collectively
enable experimental biologists to gain deeper insights from their omics
data, accelerate research workflows, and produce publication-quality
outputs without advanced computational skills.

In summary Vivid Volcano has been designed based on firsthand experience
with the challenges faced by experimental biologists working with omics
data and aims to provide comprehensive yet accessible solutions for
generating publication-ready outputs from preprocessed omics datasets.

The application is available online at
<https://datviser-vivid-volcano.share.connect.posit.cloud/>, making it
readily accessible to researchers worldwide.

# Technical description and implementation

Vivid Volcano is built as a modular R Shiny web application leveraging
the robust reactive programming model that Shiny provides. The
application architecture is characterized by clear separation between
the user interface, server logic, and data processing components. The
core functionality is implemented in R, with CSS for custom styling and
JavaScript for enhanced interactivity. The application utilizes several
key R packages, among others: shiny for the web framework [@shiny] ,
shiny.semantic[@shiny.semantic] for user interface, DT for interactive
data tables[@DT] , ggplot2[@ggplot2] and plotly[@plotly] for generating
publication-quality visualizations, GT for publication ready tables[@gt]
and shinyjs[@shinyjs] and shinyalert[@shinyalert] for improved user
experience . For statistical analysis, the application employs basic R
operations and custom functions for ontology enrichment that don't rely
on Bioconductor dependencies, making the application more accessible and
maintainable as a web tool. Data processing is handled through dplyr,
tidyr, and other tidyverse packages which provide efficient data
manipulation capabilities[@dplyr][@tidyr] . The application implements a
custom logging system to track all data transformations, ensuring
transparency and reproducibility of results. Vivid Volcano's modular
design allows for straightforward extension and maintenance, with
clearly separated UI modules for data upload, visualization, statistical
analysis, and results export. The application is deployed on Posit
Connect Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud), making it accessible via web
browser without requiring local installation.

# Statistics and Limitations

Vivid Volcano takes an innovative approach to gene set enrichment
analysis by prioritizing speed and accessibility without sacrificing
essential statistical rigor. Unlike many similar tools, it does not rely
on Bioconductor libraries, which makes the application significantly
faster, more lightweight, and better suited for web-based deployment and
non-technical user. This independence from heavy computational
dependencies allows researchers to analyze data quickly in a browser
interface, without requiring specialized software installation. Standard
Bioconductor packages typically operate on complex data structures and
specialized objects that, while powerful for comprehensive analyses,
introduce significant computational overhead unsuitable for responsive
web applications. Vivid Volcano addresses this limitation by storing
crucial Gene Ontology information in highly optimized binary parquet
files—a column-oriented data format designed for efficient querying and
retrieval. This streamlined approach provides rapid access to
approximately 8,000 GO categories and their gene associations without
the memory and processing demands of traditional Bioconductor
implementations. Vivid Volcano's gene set enrichment analysis is based
on the hypergeometric test, a robust method for determining whether
specific gene sets are overrepresented among regulated genes. This test
calculates the probability of observing the particular overlap between
regulated genes and genes belonging to specific GO categories by chance.
By comparing the actual number of regulated genes in a category against
what would be expected randomly, the test provides a measure of
enrichment. The implementation utilizes four key values: the total genes
detected in the experiment, the number of genes in a given GO category,
the total regulated genes in the experiment, and the number of regulated
genes found in that category. To control false positives, Vivid Volcano
implements multiple safeguards: multiple testing correction,
customizable significance thresholds, fold enrichment filtering, and
gene set size limitations that exclude very small or overly broad
categories. The application also transparently addresses the limitations
of standard p-value adjustment methods when applied to Gene Ontology
data. As noted in the footnotes of the results tables, traditional
approaches like Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) were not developed specifically
for hierarchical data structures like the GO tree. Thus, biologically
meaningful "parent" categories might be missed when BH over-corrects due
to many related, statistically significant "child" categories.
Conversely, overly broad categories can become significant when BH
under-corrects, driven primarily by very highly significant specialized
subcategories.

Instead of implementing complex solutions that might impede performance
and confuse users, Vivid Volcano offers a smooth user experience while
clearly communicating methodological considerations. The application
provides a pragmatic balance between statistical precision and practical
utility, making sophisticated analyses accessible to researchers without
extensive bioinformatics expertise.
